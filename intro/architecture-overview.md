Saleor is a GraphQL API that provides the backend for your frontend applications. It comes with all the notions needed to develop flexible e-commerce solutions.

Building a storefront in React.js using the Next.js framework provides plenty of benefits in the e-commerce context. By using Next.js to its full potential with advanced features such as Incremental Static Regeneration, we can build production-grade e-commerce applications with excellent performance characteristics. Such an approach is ideal for providing customers of your e-commerce solution with an exceptional user experience.

With ISR, we can do static generation on a per-page basis. We don't need to rebuild the entire site. ISR allows you to retain the benefits of static generation while scaling to millions of pages with ease.
